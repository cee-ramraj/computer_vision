I'll create an algorithm to detect the major color in a picture using Python and the Pillow library for image processing. This algorithm will use a simple approach of counting pixel colors and finding the most frequent one.

Here's the algorithm to detect the major color in a picture:

```javascript
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas');

async function detectMajorColor(imagePath) {
  // Load the image
  const image = await loadImage(imagePath);
  
  // Create a canvas and draw the image
  const canvas = createCanvas(image.width, image.height);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, image.width, image.height);
  
  // Get image data
  const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, image.width, image.height);
  const data = imageData.data;
  
  // Count color occurrences
  const colorCounts = {};
  
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    const r = data[i];
    const g = data[i + 1];
    const b = data[i + 2];
    const rgb = `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`;
    
    if (rgb in colorCounts) {
      colorCounts[rgb]++;
    } else {
      colorCounts[rgb] = 1;
    }
  }
  
  // Find the color with the highest count
  let majorColor = '';
  let maxCount = 0;
  
  for (const [color, count] of Object.entries(colorCounts)) {
    if (count > maxCount) {
      majorColor = color;
      maxCount = count;
    }
  }
  
  return majorColor;
}

// Example usage
const imagePath = './example_image.jpg';
detectMajorColor(imagePath)
  .then(majorColor => {
    console.log(`The major color in the image is: ${majorColor}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error detecting major color:', error);
  });

// Since we can't actually load an image in this environment, let's simulate the result
console.log('Simulated result: The major color in the image is: rgb(128,128,128)');
...
```

This algorithm works as follows:

1. We use the `canvas` library to load and process the image. In a real environment, you'd need to install this library using `npm install canvas`.
2. The `detectMajorColor` function is an async function that takes an image path as input.
3. We load the image and create a canvas to draw it on. This allows us to access the pixel data.
4. We iterate through all pixels in the image, counting the occurrences of each unique color.
5. After counting, we find the color with the highest count, which is considered the major color.
6. The function returns the major color as an RGB string.
7. In the example usage, we call the function with a sample image path and log the result.
8. Since we can't actually load and process an image in this Node.js sandbox environment, we simulate a result at the end.


To use this in a real environment:

1. Install the required library: `npm install canvas`
2. Replace `'./example_image.jpg'` with the path to your actual image file.
3. Run the script with Node.js.


This algorithm provides a simple way to detect the major color, but keep in mind:

- It treats each unique RGB value as a separate color. For more general results, you might want to group similar colors together.
- It doesn't account for human perception of color prominence. A small, bright area might be perceived as the "major color" even if it doesn't have the most pixels.
- For very large images, you might want to sample pixels instead of processing every single one to improve performance.


You can further improve this algorithm by adding color quantization, considering color perception models, or using clustering algorithms for more sophisticated color analysis.
