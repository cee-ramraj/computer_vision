Here's an overview of how you might go about creating an application to detect ships, boats, oil rigs, buoys, and similar objects in real-time:

### Choose a Deep Learning Framework

For real-time object detection, you'll want to use a deep learning framework. Popular choices include:

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Darknet (for YOLO)


### Select an Object Detection Model

For real-time detection, you'll need a fast and efficient model. Some good options are:

- YOLO (You Only Look Once) - particularly YOLOv5 or YOLOv7
- SSD (Single Shot Detector)
- Faster R-CNN


### Prepare Your Dataset

You'll need a dataset of labeled images containing the objects you want to detect (ships, boats, oil rigs, buoys, etc.). You can:

- Use existing datasets like COCO or OpenImages
- Create your own dataset by collecting and labeling images
- Use a combination of existing and custom data


### Train Your Model

Train your chosen model on your dataset. This will involve:

- Data preprocessing
- Model configuration
- Training process
- Validation and testing


### Implement Real-time Detection

Once your model is trained, implement it in a real-time application:

- Use a camera feed or video input
- Process frames in real-time
- Display results with bounding boxes and labels


### Optimize for Performance

To achieve real-time performance:

- Use GPU acceleration if available
- Optimize your model (e.g., quantization, pruning)
- Consider edge devices for deployment (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)


### Create User Interface

Develop a user interface to display the video feed with detected objects.
```python
import cv2
import torch
from models.experimental import attempt_load
from utils.general import non_max_suppression
from utils.torch_utils import select_device

# Load YOLOv5 model
device = select_device('')
model = attempt_load('yolov5s.pt', map_location=device)

# Set up camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read frame from camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Preprocess frame
    img = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img = torch.from_numpy(img).to(device)
    img = img.float() / 255.0
    img = img.permute(2, 0, 1).unsqueeze(0)

    # Run inference
    pred = model(img)[0]
    pred = non_max_suppression(pred, 0.25, 0.45)

    # Process detections
    for det in pred[0]:
        if det is not None and len(det):
            for *xyxy, conf, cls in det:
                label = f'{model.names[int(cls)]} {conf:.2f}'
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (int(xyxy[0]), int(xyxy[1])), (int(xyxy[2]), int(xyxy[3])), (255, 0, 0), 2)
                cv2.putText(frame, label, (int(xyxy[0]), int(xyxy[1])-10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (255,0,0), 2)

    # Display result
    cv2.imshow('Object Detection', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```



This script provides a starting point, but you would need to:

1. Install the necessary libraries (PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5)
2. Train or fine-tune the YOLOv5 model on your specific dataset
3. Adjust the confidence thresholds and post-processing as needed
4. Implement error handling and performance optimizations


Remember, real-time object detection, especially for specific objects like ships and oil rigs, is a complex task that requires significant computational resources and expertise in computer vision and deep learning. You might need to iterate and refine your approach based on the specific requirements and performance of your application.
