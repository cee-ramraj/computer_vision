Training an object identification algorithm with fewer than 20 images per class can be quite challenging because deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), typically require large datasets to generalize well. However, there are several techniques you can use to train models effectively with limited data:

### 1. **Data Augmentation**
One of the most effective ways to deal with a small dataset is to apply data augmentation, which artificially increases the number of training examples by applying various transformations to the existing images. These transformations include:

- **Rotation**: Rotating the image by small angles.
- **Scaling**: Resizing the image.
- **Flipping**: Horizontal or vertical flipping.
- **Cropping**: Random or center cropping.
- **Brightness and Contrast Adjustments**: Changing the lighting conditions.
- **Noise Addition**: Adding random noise to make the model more robust.
  
Libraries like Keras and PyTorch provide built-in data augmentation techniques.

Example in PyTorch:
```python
from torchvision import transforms

# Define your augmentations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1),
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=(224, 224), scale=(0.8, 1.0)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

# Apply the transformations to your dataset
augmented_image = transform(image)
```

### 2. **Transfer Learning**
Transfer learning allows you to leverage pre-trained models (like ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) that were trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet). You can fine-tune these models with your small dataset by modifying the final classification layer to fit your specific task.

Steps for transfer learning:
1. **Load a pre-trained model**: Most deep learning frameworks offer pre-trained models.
2. **Replace the final layer**: Adapt the output layer to match the number of classes in your dataset.
3. **Freeze earlier layers**: Freeze the initial layers of the model to retain the learned features and only train the last few layers.

Example in Keras:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze all layers in the base model
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add a custom classification layer on top
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Replace 10 with the number of classes
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)
```

### 3. **Few-Shot Learning**
Few-shot learning is designed for scenarios where you have very few examples per class. The goal is to build models that can generalize well from just a handful of images. There are specific architectures and techniques to handle few-shot learning, including:

- **Siamese Networks**: These networks learn to compare pairs of images and predict whether they belong to the same class or not. They are often used in face recognition tasks.
- **Prototypical Networks**: These models compute a prototype (mean representation) for each class and classify new examples based on proximity to these prototypes.
- **Matching Networks**: Similar to Prototypical Networks, they classify by comparing a test example to a few labeled examples.

Example of using a Siamese network in PyTorch:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SiameseNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SiameseNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.convnet = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=10),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=7),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=4),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=4),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
        )
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(256*6*6, 4096),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        # Forward pass through convolutional layers
        output1 = self.convnet(x1)
        output2 = self.convnet(x2)
        # Flatten and pass through fully connected layer
        output1 = self.fc(output1.view(output1.size(0), -1))
        output2 = self.fc(output2.view(output2.size(0), -1))
        # Return the L1 distance between the two outputs
        return torch.abs(output1 - output2)

# Train Siamese Network with contrastive loss for few-shot learning
```

Few-shot learning is effective in scenarios where you have very limited data, and it's worth exploring if you are working with fewer than 20 images.

### 4. **Pre-Trained Embeddings (Feature Extraction)**
Instead of training an entire model from scratch, you can use pre-trained models to extract feature embeddings for your images. Then, you can apply simple machine learning algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machines) or k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) on top of these embeddings for classification.

Steps:
1. **Use a pre-trained model** (e.g., ResNet) to extract feature vectors from your small dataset.
2. **Train a classifier** (like SVM) on these feature vectors.

```python
# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, pooling='avg')

# Extract features from your images
features = base_model.predict(images)

# Train an SVM classifier on the extracted features
from sklearn.svm import SVC
classifier = SVC(kernel='linear')
classifier.fit(features, labels)
```

### 5. **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**
After transferring a pre-trained model, fine-tuning it (instead of freezing all layers) may give better performance with limited data. You can selectively unfreeze the last few layers of the pre-trained model to adapt to your small dataset.

Example of unfreezing and fine-tuning:
```python
for layer in base_model.layers[-10:]:  # Unfreeze last 10 layers
    layer.trainable = True
```

### 6. **One-Shot Learning** (Extreme Case of Few-Shot Learning)
In cases where you have just one example per class, one-shot learning techniques, such as those using **Siamese Networks** or **Memory-Augmented Neural Networks** (MANN), are suitable.

These networks learn a similarity function that determines whether two images belong to the same class, even when trained on very few samples.

---

### Conclusion:
With fewer than 20 images per class, transfer learning and data augmentation will likely be your best approaches. You can leverage pre-trained models, apply data augmentation to create more training examples, and fine-tune the models to adapt them to your task. Few-shot learning techniques, such as Siamese Networks, are also highly effective for recognizing objects with minimal data.
