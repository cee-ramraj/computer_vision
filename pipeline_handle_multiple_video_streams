I'll create a pipeline to handle multiple video streams for real-time object detection using a pre-trained model. We'll use Python with OpenCV for video processing, PyTorch for the deep learning model, and multiprocessing to handle multiple streams concurrently. We'll assume we're using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model for this example.

Here's a detailed implementation:

### Set up the environment

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 (can be installed via pip)


### Create the main script

We'll create a main script that will set up the video streams and manage the multiprocessing.

### Implement the detection function

We'll create a function to handle the object detection for each video stream.

### Set up multiprocessing

We'll use Python's multiprocessing to handle multiple video streams concurrently.

### Run the pipeline

Finally, we'll set up the main execution of our pipeline.

Now, let's implement this pipeline:

```python 
import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
import time

# Assuming YOLOv5 is installed
from yolov5.models.experimental import attempt_load
from yolov5.utils.general import non_max_suppression, scale_coords
from yolov5.utils.torch_utils import select_device

def load_model(weights='yolov5s.pt'):
    device = select_device('')
    model = attempt_load(weights, map_location=device)
    return model, device

def detect_objects(model, frame, device):
    img = torch.from_numpy(frame).to(device)
    img = img.float() / 255.0
    if img.ndimension() == 3:
        img = img.unsqueeze(0)
    img = img.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)

    pred = model(img)[0]
    pred = non_max_suppression(pred, 0.25, 0.45)

    return pred[0] if pred[0] is not None else []

def process_stream(stream_url, output_queue, model, device):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(stream_url)
    
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        frame_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        detections = detect_objects(model, frame_rgb, device)

        result_frame = frame.copy()
        for *xyxy, conf, cls in detections:
            label = f'{model.names[int(cls)]} {conf:.2f}'
            cv2.rectangle(result_frame, (int(xyxy[0]), int(xyxy[1])), (int(xyxy[2]), int(xyxy[3])), (255, 0, 0), 2)
            cv2.putText(result_frame, label, (int(xyxy[0]), int(xyxy[1])-10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (255,0,0), 2)

        output_queue.put((stream_url, result_frame))

    cap.release()

def display_results(output_queue, num_streams):
    windows = {}

    while True:
        if output_queue.empty():
            time.sleep(0.1)
            continue

        stream_url, frame = output_queue.get()
        
        if stream_url not in windows:
            windows[stream_url] = f"Stream {len(windows) + 1}"
            cv2.namedWindow(windows[stream_url], cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)

        cv2.imshow(windows[stream_url], frame)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

def main():
    # List of video stream URLs
    stream_urls = [
        'rtsp://stream1_url',
        'rtsp://stream2_url',
        'rtsp://stream3_url',
        # Add more stream URLs as needed
    ]

    model, device = load_model()
    output_queue = Queue()

    processes = []
    for url in stream_urls:
        p = Process(target=process_stream, args=(url, output_queue, model, device))
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)

    display_process = Process(target=display_results, args=(output_queue, len(stream_urls)))
    display_process.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    display_process.join()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
...

This script does the following:

1. We define functions to load the YOLOv5 model and perform object detection.
2. The `process_stream` function handles each video stream. It continuously reads frames, performs object detection, and puts the results in a queue.
3. The `display_results` function reads from the queue and displays the processed frames with detected objects.
4. In the `main` function, we set up multiprocessing to handle multiple streams concurrently. Each stream is processed in a separate process.
5. We use a separate process for displaying results to ensure smooth visualization.


To use this script:

1. Replace the `stream_urls` list with your actual video stream URLs.
2. Ensure you have the YOLOv5 weights file (e.g., 'yolov5s.pt') in the same directory or provide the correct path.
3. Run the script.


This implementation provides a foundation for real-time multi-stream object detection. Depending on your specific requirements and the capabilities of your hardware, you might need to make further optimizations:

- If CPU usage is high, you might want to consider using a lighter model or reducing the frequency of detection.
- For better performance, you could use a GPU if available by modifying the `select_device` function call.
- You might want to add logging or error handling for production use.
- Consider adding a mechanism to gracefully stop the processes when you want to end the program.


Remember, the performance of this system will depend heavily on your hardware capabilities, the number of streams, and the complexity of the object detection model. You may need to adjust parameters or use more optimized models for real-time performance with multiple high-resolution streams.
