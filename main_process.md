# Main Process

For your maritime object detection, tracking, and analysis system, let's outline a series of algorithms, pipelines, and modules to address each of your requirements effectively. Here's a structured approach:

---

### **System Overview**
This system leverages real-time data from multiple optical and infrared cameras mounted on a moving ship. The system processes incoming video feeds, performs object detection and identification, extracts kinematic information, and implements collision avoidance strategies.

### **Pipeline Structure**

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
   - Input: Video feeds from optical and infrared cameras.
   - Steps:
     - Synchronize and calibrate camera inputs to account for slight time offsets.
     - Preprocess frames for noise reduction, especially in low-visibility conditions (e.g., fog, rain).
     - Enhance images for clarity, particularly in thermal images where object edges may be less defined.

2. **Object Detection Module**
   - Algorithms: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, or custom CNN tuned for maritime objects.
   - Approach:
     - Use transfer learning with maritime-specific datasets to detect objects of interest like ships, oil rigs, and fishing vessels.
     - Run object detection in real-time and annotate detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
   - Multi-Frame Verification:
     - Use temporal consistency by verifying detections across frames to reduce false positives due to environmental noise.

3. **Object Identification Module**
   - Algorithms: ResNet, MobileNet, or custom CNN for feature extraction; integrate Siamese Network for identification of known versus unknown objects.
   - Approach:
     - Identify object categories (e.g., fishing vessel, oil rig) by matching against a database of known object features.
     - If object identification is uncertain, flag the object for database storage.
   - Modules:
     - **Known Object Database**: A database containing labeled features of identified maritime objects.
     - **Unknown Object Storage**: For objects that cannot be identified, store high-quality snapshots in a database for future analysis.

4. **Kinematic Analysis Module**
   - Algorithms: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, or Extended Kalman Filter for trajectory tracking; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predictive kinematics.
   - Approach:
     - Calculate speed, direction, and position of detected objects across frames.
     - Predict future positions to help in real-time trajectory smoothing and collision avoidance.
     - Track object state over time to maintain accurate kinematic profiles.
   - Output:
     - Object location, velocity vector, and estimated future positions.

5. **Collision Avoidance Module**
   - Algorithms: Dynamic Collision Avoidance System using Reinforcement Learning (DCA-RL) or Rule-Based Collision Detection (RBCD).
   - Approach:
     - Calculate distance and approach vectors for each detected object relative to the ship.
     - Assess collision risk based on relative speeds, directions, and predicted paths.
     - Trigger alerts and recommend evasive maneuvers if collision risk exceeds a threshold.
   - Modules:
     - **Risk Assessment Engine**: Computes collision likelihood using object trajectories and ship movement.
     - **Evasive Action Logger**: Records recommended actions, taken actions, and outcomes for each collision threat.

6. **Database and Record Maintenance Module**
   - Structure:
     - **Objects Database**: Stores metadata for each detected object, including kinematic data, identification status, detection and identification timestamps, and category.
     - **Collision Avoidance Logs**: Records every action, algorithmic decision, and outcome in response to collision threats.
   - Process:
     - For each identified or unidentified object, maintain detailed logs of kinematics, detection/identification times, and any changes in category identification.
     - Append records on detection status (e.g., known vs. unknown) and store frames for unidentified objects.

7. **Data Storage and Retrieval Module**
   - Ensure efficient storage of large datasets, particularly frames and video snippets containing unidentified objects and collision avoidance actions.
   - Use indexing and metadata tagging for easy retrieval and analysis of past incidents, object encounters, and collision scenarios.

---

### **Module Implementations and Algorithms**

1. **Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking**
   - **Optical and IR Image Alignment**: Register frames from optical and IR feeds using homography transformations to create a fused view.
   - **Detection and Tracking Algorithm**: YOLOv8 or Faster R-CNN for object detection; Kalman Filter for tracking detected objects across frames.
   
2. **Object Identification**
   - **Feature Matching and Classification**: CNN-based feature extraction, matched with known objects; unidentified objects trigger image storage.
   - **Database Integration**: Fast query system for comparing live data against the existing database.

3. **Real-Time Kinematics Computation**
   - **Object Kinematics Algorithm**: Use a Kalman Filter to compute speed, acceleration, and trajectory; predict future states using a trajectory smoothing LSTM network.
   
4. **Collision Avoidance Logic**
   - **Collision Prediction**: Calculate time-to-collision (TTC) based on relative velocities; implement reinforcement learning to refine avoidance actions.
   - **Action Logging**: For every collision risk detected, log recommended action, actual evasive maneuver, and post-maneuver results.

5. **Storage and Retrieval**
   - **Database Schema**: Design schema to efficiently store and retrieve object data, identification statuses, and collision events.
   - **Compression and Indexing**: Compress stored images and videos and use indexing to optimize retrieval based on timestamps, kinematic profiles, and identification status.

---

### **Example of Process Flow**

1. **Data Capture**: Cameras capture frames, preprocess and fuse them.
2. **Object Detection**: Detect objects in each frame and initiate kinematic analysis for detected objects.
3. **Identification**: Attempt to identify detected objects; if identification fails, store high-quality snapshots.
4. **Kinematics and Tracking**: Calculate real-time kinematics and store object movement patterns.
5. **Collision Detection and Evasion**: Identify potential collisions and log all recommended or taken actions.
6. **Record Maintenance**: Store details of detection, identification, kinematics, and collision avoidance logs in the database.

---

### **Considerations for Real-Time Performance**

- Use hardware accelerators (like GPUs) and efficient algorithms (YOLO, ResNet) for real-time processing.
- Streamline data handling with multiprocessing or parallelized data pipelines to maintain low latency in detection and identification.
- Optimize database queries to avoid delays in object identification and history retrieval.

This approach provides a structured, modular system for comprehensive situational awareness, object identification, and collision management on a maritime platform.

# System Design

To implement a robust system for real-time object detection, identification, kinematic tracking, and collision avoidance using multiple optical and infrared cameras on a moving ship, we'll need to delve into several specific algorithms, modules, and code segments.

This system can be broken down into the following main modules:

1. **Camera Synchronization and Data Preprocessing**
2. **Object Detection and Identification**
3. **Kinematic Tracking**
4. **Collision Avoidance**
5. **Event Logging and Data Management**

Each module requires specific algorithms and functions to ensure efficient and reliable real-time processing. Here is a structured approach with code snippets for each module:

---

### 1. **Camera Synchronization and Data Preprocessing**

Since the system uses multiple cameras, it's crucial to synchronize and preprocess the video feeds. This module handles image alignment, noise reduction, and preparing the frames for object detection.

#### Algorithm:
   - **Synchronization**: Align frames from each camera based on timestamps or through image registration techniques.
   - **Preprocessing**: Apply filtering (Gaussian, median) to reduce noise, and enhance images for better detection accuracy.

#### Code:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

class CameraSyncAndPreprocess:
    def __init__(self, cam1, cam2):
        self.cam1 = cam1  # Optical camera feed
        self.cam2 = cam2  # Infrared camera feed

    def read_frames(self):
        ret1, frame1 = self.cam1.read()
        ret2, frame2 = self.cam2.read()
        
        if not ret1 or not ret2:
            return None, None  # End of feed or error
        
        return frame1, frame2

    def preprocess_frame(self, frame):
        # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and enhance image quality
        frame = cv2.GaussianBlur(frame, (5, 5), 0)
        # Additional processing steps can be added
        return frame

    def align_frames(self, frame1, frame2):
        # Basic alignment using feature-based registration
        # For more advanced alignment, homography transformations can be used
        gray1 = cv2.cvtColor(frame1, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        gray2 = cv2.cvtColor(frame2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        return gray1, gray2  # Return aligned frames if needed

    def process(self):
        frame1, frame2 = self.read_frames()
        if frame1 is None or frame2 is None:
            return None, None
        
        frame1 = self.preprocess_frame(frame1)
        frame2 = self.preprocess_frame(frame2)
        
        return self.align_frames(frame1, frame2)
```

---

### 2. **Object Detection and Identification**

This module detects objects using a model (e.g., YOLOv5 or YOLOv8) trained on maritime objects and attempts to classify each detected object.

#### Algorithm:
   - **Detection**: Run object detection on each preprocessed frame.
   - **Identification**: Compare detected objects against a database or feature set of known objects for identification.

#### Code:

```python
from yolov5 import YOLOv5  # YOLOv5 wrapper

class ObjectDetectionAndIdentification:
    def __init__(self, model_path, known_objects_db):
        self.yolo = YOLOv5(model_path)  # Path to YOLO model
        self.known_objects_db = known_objects_db  # Preloaded database of known objects

    def detect_objects(self, frame):
        results = self.yolo.predict(frame)
        detections = [{"label": obj['label'], "bbox": obj['bbox'], "confidence": obj['confidence']} for obj in results if obj['confidence'] > 0.5]
        return detections

    def identify_object(self, detection):
        label = detection['label']
        if label in self.known_objects_db:
            return self.known_objects_db[label]
        return "Unknown"

    def process_frame(self, frame):
        detections = self.detect_objects(frame)
        for detection in detections:
            object_id = self.identify_object(detection)
            detection['id'] = object_id
        return detections
```

---

### 3. **Kinematic Tracking**

The Kinematic Tracking module calculates the position, speed, and direction of detected objects over time using a Kalman Filter. This information is essential for trajectory prediction and collision avoidance.

#### Algorithm:
   - **Tracking with Kalman Filter**: Estimate position and velocity based on detected object’s motion.
   - **Trajectory Prediction**: Use Kalman filter updates to predict future states.

#### Code:

```python
from filterpy.kalman import KalmanFilter

class KinematicTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trackers = {}

    def init_kalman_filter(self, object_id):
        kf = KalmanFilter(dim_x=4, dim_z=2)
        kf.F = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
        kf.H = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]])
        kf.P *= 1000
        kf.R *= 0.1
        self.trackers[object_id] = kf

    def update_tracker(self, object_id, position):
        if object_id not in self.trackers:
            self.init_kalman_filter(object_id)
        kf = self.trackers[object_id]
        kf.predict()
        kf.update(np.array(position))
        x, y, vx, vy = kf.x
        return {"position": (x, y), "velocity": (vx, vy)}

    def process_detections(self, detections):
        kinematics = {}
        for detection in detections:
            object_id = detection['id']
            bbox_center = (detection['bbox'][0] + detection['bbox'][2] // 2, detection['bbox'][1] + detection['bbox'][3] // 2)
            kinematics[object_id] = self.update_tracker(object_id, bbox_center)
        return kinematics
```

---

### 4. **Collision Avoidance**

The Collision Avoidance module calculates potential collision risks based on kinematic data. It assesses the proximity of detected objects and, if necessary, triggers evasive actions.

#### Algorithm:
   - **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Calculate time until potential collision.
   - **Risk Threshold**: Trigger collision avoidance if TTC falls below a critical value.

#### Code:

```python
class CollisionAvoidance:
    def __init__(self, threshold=30):  # Collision threshold (in seconds)
        self.threshold = threshold

    def calculate_ttc(self, pos1, vel1, pos2, vel2):
        rel_velocity = np.subtract(vel2, vel1)
        rel_position = np.subtract(pos2, pos1)
        dist = np.linalg.norm(rel_position)
        
        if dist < 1e-5:
            return 0
        
        ttc = np.dot(rel_position, rel_velocity) / np.linalg.norm(rel_velocity)**2
        return ttc if ttc > 0 else float('inf')

    def assess_risks(self, kinematics):
        collision_risks = []
        object_ids = list(kinematics.keys())
        
        for i in range(len(object_ids)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(object_ids)):
                id1, id2 = object_ids[i], object_ids[j]
                obj1, obj2 = kinematics[id1], kinematics[id2]
                ttc = self.calculate_ttc(obj1['position'], obj1['velocity'], obj2['position'], obj2['velocity'])
                
                if ttc < self.threshold:
                    collision_risks.append((id1, id2, ttc))
        
        return collision_risks
```

---

### 5. **Event Logging and Data Management**

This module logs detection events, stores unidentified object images, and maintains collision avoidance records.

#### Code:

```python
import datetime

class EventLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []

    def log_detection(self, detection, kinematic_data):
        event = {
            "type": "detection",
            "object_id": detection['id'],
            "time": datetime.datetime.now(),
            "data": {
                "label": detection['label'],
                "bbox": detection['bbox'],
                "kinematics": kinematic_data
            }
        }
        self.events.append(event)

    def log_collision_avoidance(self, obj1_id, obj2_id, ttc):
        event = {
            "type": "collision_avoidance",
            "time": datetime.datetime.now(),
            "data": {
                "objects": [obj1_id, obj2_id],
                "time_to_collision": ttc
            }
        }
        self.events.append(event)

    def save_log(self, filepath):
        # Saving to JSON or a database
        with open(filepath, "w") as f:
            json.dump(self.events, f, default=str)
```

---

### **Main Loop to Integrate Modules**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cap1 = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/optical_camera")
    cap2 = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/ir_camera")
    
    sync_preprocess = CameraSyncAndPreprocess(cap1, cap2)
    detector_identifier = ObjectDetectionAndIdentification("path/to/yolo_model.pt", known_objects_db={})
    kinematic_tracker = Kinematic

Tracker()
    collision_avoider = CollisionAvoidance()
    logger = EventLogger()

    while cap1.isOpened() and cap2.isOpened():
        frame1, frame2 = sync_preprocess.process()
        if frame1 is None or frame2 is None:
            break
        
        detections = detector_identifier.process_frame(frame1)
        kinematics = kinematic_tracker.process_detections(detections)
        collision_risks = collision_avoider.assess_risks(kinematics)

        for detection in detections:
            logger.log_detection(detection, kinematics[detection['id']])
        
        for risk in collision_risks:
            logger.log_collision_avoidance(*risk)

    logger.save_log("collision_and_detection_log.json")
    cap1.release()
    cap2.release()
```

This main loop runs through each stage of the pipeline, ensuring synchronized processing across modules for real-time detection, identification, kinematic analysis, collision detection, and logging. Each module can be enhanced with further refinements as needed for specific maritime environments.

# Starter Code

Below is a starter code outline that covers key modules for object detection, identification, tracking, and collision avoidance. This code structure assumes a Python-based implementation using libraries like OpenCV for image handling, YOLO for detection, and Kalman Filters for kinematics. In a real-world setup, you would expand this with models trained for maritime environments and optimized for real-time performance.

This starter code demonstrates the main components and flow for building a functional prototype.

This starter code demonstrates the modular approach needed for real-time processing and kinematic analysis on maritime objects. Further development will include tuning the collision risk logic, handling database integration for known objects, and refining the visualization for real-time monitoring.
