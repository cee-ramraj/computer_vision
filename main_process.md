# Main Process

For your maritime object detection, tracking, and analysis system, let's outline a series of algorithms, pipelines, and modules to address each of your requirements effectively. Here's a structured approach:

---

### **System Overview**
This system leverages real-time data from multiple optical and infrared cameras mounted on a moving ship. The system processes incoming video feeds, performs object detection and identification, extracts kinematic information, and implements collision avoidance strategies.

### **Pipeline Structure**

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
   - Input: Video feeds from optical and infrared cameras.
   - Steps:
     - Synchronize and calibrate camera inputs to account for slight time offsets.
     - Preprocess frames for noise reduction, especially in low-visibility conditions (e.g., fog, rain).
     - Enhance images for clarity, particularly in thermal images where object edges may be less defined.

2. **Object Detection Module**
   - Algorithms: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, or custom CNN tuned for maritime objects.
   - Approach:
     - Use transfer learning with maritime-specific datasets to detect objects of interest like ships, oil rigs, and fishing vessels.
     - Run object detection in real-time and annotate detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
   - Multi-Frame Verification:
     - Use temporal consistency by verifying detections across frames to reduce false positives due to environmental noise.

3. **Object Identification Module**
   - Algorithms: ResNet, MobileNet, or custom CNN for feature extraction; integrate Siamese Network for identification of known versus unknown objects.
   - Approach:
     - Identify object categories (e.g., fishing vessel, oil rig) by matching against a database of known object features.
     - If object identification is uncertain, flag the object for database storage.
   - Modules:
     - **Known Object Database**: A database containing labeled features of identified maritime objects.
     - **Unknown Object Storage**: For objects that cannot be identified, store high-quality snapshots in a database for future analysis.

4. **Kinematic Analysis Module**
   - Algorithms: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, or Extended Kalman Filter for trajectory tracking; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predictive kinematics.
   - Approach:
     - Calculate speed, direction, and position of detected objects across frames.
     - Predict future positions to help in real-time trajectory smoothing and collision avoidance.
     - Track object state over time to maintain accurate kinematic profiles.
   - Output:
     - Object location, velocity vector, and estimated future positions.

5. **Collision Avoidance Module**
   - Algorithms: Dynamic Collision Avoidance System using Reinforcement Learning (DCA-RL) or Rule-Based Collision Detection (RBCD).
   - Approach:
     - Calculate distance and approach vectors for each detected object relative to the ship.
     - Assess collision risk based on relative speeds, directions, and predicted paths.
     - Trigger alerts and recommend evasive maneuvers if collision risk exceeds a threshold.
   - Modules:
     - **Risk Assessment Engine**: Computes collision likelihood using object trajectories and ship movement.
     - **Evasive Action Logger**: Records recommended actions, taken actions, and outcomes for each collision threat.

6. **Database and Record Maintenance Module**
   - Structure:
     - **Objects Database**: Stores metadata for each detected object, including kinematic data, identification status, detection and identification timestamps, and category.
     - **Collision Avoidance Logs**: Records every action, algorithmic decision, and outcome in response to collision threats.
   - Process:
     - For each identified or unidentified object, maintain detailed logs of kinematics, detection/identification times, and any changes in category identification.
     - Append records on detection status (e.g., known vs. unknown) and store frames for unidentified objects.

7. **Data Storage and Retrieval Module**
   - Ensure efficient storage of large datasets, particularly frames and video snippets containing unidentified objects and collision avoidance actions.
   - Use indexing and metadata tagging for easy retrieval and analysis of past incidents, object encounters, and collision scenarios.

### **Module Implementations and Algorithms**

1. **Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking**
   - **Optical and IR Image Alignment**: Register frames from optical and IR feeds using homography transformations to create a fused view.
   - **Detection and Tracking Algorithm**: YOLOv8 or Faster R-CNN for object detection; Kalman Filter for tracking detected objects across frames.
   
2. **Object Identification**
   - **Feature Matching and Classification**: CNN-based feature extraction, matched with known objects; unidentified objects trigger image storage.
   - **Database Integration**: Fast query system for comparing live data against the existing database.

3. **Real-Time Kinematics Computation**
   - **Object Kinematics Algorithm**: Use a Kalman Filter to compute speed, acceleration, and trajectory; predict future states using a trajectory smoothing LSTM network.
   
4. **Collision Avoidance Logic**
   - **Collision Prediction**: Calculate time-to-collision (TTC) based on relative velocities; implement reinforcement learning to refine avoidance actions.
   - **Action Logging**: For every collision risk detected, log recommended action, actual evasive maneuver, and post-maneuver results.

5. **Storage and Retrieval**
   - **Database Schema**: Design schema to efficiently store and retrieve object data, identification statuses, and collision events.
   - **Compression and Indexing**: Compress stored images and videos and use indexing to optimize retrieval based on timestamps, kinematic profiles, and identification status.

---

### **Example of Process Flow**

1. **Data Capture**: Cameras capture frames, preprocess and fuse them.
2. **Object Detection**: Detect objects in each frame and initiate kinematic analysis for detected objects.
3. **Identification**: Attempt to identify detected objects; if identification fails, store high-quality snapshots.
4. **Kinematics and Tracking**: Calculate real-time kinematics and store object movement patterns.
5. **Collision Detection and Evasion**: Identify potential collisions and log all recommended or taken actions.
6. **Record Maintenance**: Store details of detection, identification, kinematics, and collision avoidance logs in the database.

### **Considerations for Real-Time Performance**

- Use hardware accelerators (like GPUs) and efficient algorithms (YOLO, ResNet) for real-time processing.
- Streamline data handling with multiprocessing or parallelized data pipelines to maintain low latency in detection and identification.
- Optimize database queries to avoid delays in object identification and history retrieval.

This approach provides a structured, modular system for comprehensive situational awareness, object identification, and collision management on a maritime platform.

# Starter Code

Below is a starter code outline that covers key modules for object detection, identification, tracking, and collision avoidance. This code structure assumes a Python-based implementation using libraries like OpenCV for image handling, YOLO for detection, and Kalman Filters for kinematics. In a real-world setup, you would expand this with models trained for maritime environments and optimized for real-time performance.

This starter code demonstrates the main components and flow for building a functional prototype.

### **Explanation of Key Components**

1. **`MaritimeObjectDetector` Class**:
   - **`preprocess_frame`**: Basic image preprocessing, particularly for aligning and preparing frames for detection.
   - **`detect_objects`**: Uses YOLO to detect objects in the frame. Detections are returned with bounding box and confidence.
   - **`identify_object`**: Basic identification mechanism, storing unknown objects for future reference.
   - **`init_kalman_filter` and `update_kinematics`**: Kalman Filter to track object kinematics over time.
   - **`collision_risk`**: Calculates collision risk using a simplified time-to-collision metric.
   - **`log_event`**: Logs detection and collision events.

2. **Main Pipeline**:
   - Processes each frame, performs object detection, updates kinematic state, checks for potential collisions, and logs events.
   
This starter code demonstrates the modular approach needed for real-time processing and kinematic analysis on maritime objects. Further development will include tuning the collision risk logic, handling database integration for known objects, and refining the visualization for real-time monitoring.
